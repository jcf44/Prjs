# Voice Mode User Guide

Wendy's Voice Mode allows you to interact with your assistant completely hands-free using voice commands.

## How to Use Voice Mode

1.  **Activate Voice Mode**
    *   Click the **Microphone Icon** in the right sidebar of the dashboard.
    *   The icon will turn red and pulse, indicating the voice engine is active.

2.  **Wait for Wake Word**
    *   Look at the status indicator below the microphone.
    *   It should say **"Say 'Hey Wendy'"**.
    *   The system is now listening specifically for the wake word.

3.  **Say "Hey Wendy"**
    *   Speak the wake word clearly.
    *   When detected, the status will change to **"Listening..."**.
    *   You may hear a confirmation sound (if enabled).

4.  **Speak Your Command**
    *   Ask your question or give a command naturally.
    *   Examples:
        *   "What is the capital of France?"
        *   "Summarize the last document I uploaded."
        *   "Create a todo list for my project."
    *   The system records until you stop speaking (it detects silence).

5.  **Processing**
    *   The status will change to **"Processing..."**.
    *   Wendy is transcribing your speech, thinking about the answer, and generating a voice response.

6.  **Response**
    *   Wendy will speak the answer back to you.
    *   The text of the conversation will also appear in the main chat window.

7.  **Loop**
    *   After speaking, the system returns to **"Say 'Hey Wendy'"** mode.
    *   You can immediately say "Hey Wendy" again for follow-up questions.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Status stays on "Processing..."**: The system might be initializing. If it takes too long, try toggling the microphone off and on.
*   **Doesn't hear "Hey Wendy"**: Try speaking closer to the microphone or slightly louder. Ensure your microphone permissions are allowed in the browser.
*   **Cuts off too early**: Try to speak continuously without long pauses until you are finished.
